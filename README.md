    <h2 id="direct-form-of-fir-filter-implementation">Direct Form of FIR Filter Implementation</h2>

    <h3 id="theoretical-filter-designing">Theoretical Filter Designing</h3>
    <p>The direct form FIR filter design involves multiplying filter coefficients by the input signal and summing the results. The filter is designed to pass frequencies above 70 Hz, with a stop frequency of 45 Hz and a pass frequency of 60 Hz, sampled at 500 Hz.</p>

    <h3 id="implementation-with-vhdl">Implementation with VHDL</h3>
    <p>The VHDL implementation uses 8-bit input data and produces a 22-bit output. Due to the antisymmetric properties of the FIR filter coefficients, only half of the coefficients are calculated, optimizing the design.</p>

    <h3 id="empirical-results">Empirical Results</h3>
    <p>The empirical results, saved in <code>output.txt</code>, match the theoretical design, demonstrating effective high-frequency filtering as shown in the FFT analysis.</p>

    <h2 id="transpose-form-of-fir-filter">Transpose Form of FIR Filter</h2>

    <h3 id="theoretical-filter-designing-1">Theoretical Filter Designing</h3>
    <p>The transposed form of the FIR filter involves reversing the order of input and output compared to the direct form.</p>

    <h3 id="implementation-with-vhdl-1">Implementation with VHDL</h3>
    <p>In the VHDL implementation, the input data remains 8-bit, but the output is expanded to 33-bit due to additional bit generation in each step of the summation.</p>

    <h3 id="empirical-results-1">Empirical Results</h3>
    <p>The empirical results for the transposed form, analyzed using MATLAB, show a similar high-pass filtering performance with slight differences compared to the direct form.</p>

    <h2 id="maximum-frequency-comparison-between-two-methods">Maximum Frequency Comparison between Two Methods</h2>
    <p>The maximum frequency for the transposed FIR filter implementation is 327.04 MHz, indicating a higher speed compared to the direct form. This demonstrates the efficiency gain by using the transposed method for FIR filter implementation.</p>

# High-pass-FIR-16-TAP-implementation-using-VHDL
This project implements a 16-tap High Pass FIR filter (and it's transposed) using VHDL. First we design the filter with Matlab.
